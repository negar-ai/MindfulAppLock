# Mindful App Lock
Mindful App Lock is an Android app designed to help users reduce the time spent on distracting apps by introducing mindful moments before accessing them. The app provides a simple, effective way to improve focus and mindfulness through brief challenges or tasks.

Features
Mindfulness Challenges: Users need to finish a small task, such as breathing exercises and responding to the daily question, before they can access a restricted app.

Emergency Bypass: Users have a once-a-day emergency bypass button that allows them to access an app without completing a challenge. However, once used, the bypass canâ€™t be used again until the next day.

Tech Stack
Frontend: Kivy (Python-based framework for building cross-platform apps)

Languages: Python

Packaging for Android: Buildozer (to package the app for Android)
