# Mindful App Lock

Emergency Bypass: Users have a once-a-day emergency bypass button that allows them to access an app without completing a challenge. However, once used, the bypass canâ€™t be used again until the next day.

Customizable Task Difficulty: The difficulty of challenges progressively increases the more frequently the user tries to access an app, encouraging intentional use.
